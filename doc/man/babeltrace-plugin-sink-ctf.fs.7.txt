NAME
----
babeltrace-plugin-sink-ctf.fs - Babeltrace's CTF to file system
sink component class


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The Babeltrace `ctf.fs` sink component class, member of the
man:babeltrace-plugin-ctf(7) plugin, once instantiated, writes the
events it receives in one or more CTF traces on the local file system.

----

A `ctf.fs` sink component uses the trace names of the received events,
when possible, to try to reconstitute the original trace hierarchy on
the file system. For example, given the following paths handled by
different source components in the conversion graph:

----
/path/
    to-some/
        dir/
            trace1/
                metadata
                ...
            my-traces/
                best-trace/
                    metadata
                    ...
                a-log.txt
            trace2/
                metadata
                ...
----

If the received events are attached to traces having the following
names:

----
/path/to-some/dir/trace1
/path/to-some/dir/my-traces/best-trace
/path/to-some/dir/my-traces/a-log.txt
/path/to-some/dir/trace2
----

A `ctf.fs` sink component with the param:path parameter set to `/output`
would write the following hierarchy of CTF traces:

----
/output/
    path/
        to-some/
            dir/
                trace1/
                    metadata
                    ...
                my-traces/
                    best-trace/
                        metadata
                        ...
                    a-log/
                        metadata
                        ...
                trace2/
                    metadata
                    ...
