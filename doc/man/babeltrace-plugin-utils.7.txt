NAME
----
babeltrace-plugin-utils - Babeltrace's utility plugin


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The Babeltrace `utils` plugin contains common, generic utility component
classes which you can use in any conversion graph.


COMPONENT CLASSES
-----------------
`utils.dummy` *sink*::
    Receives the events from all its connections and discards them (does
    absolutely nothing with them).
+
See man:babeltrace-plugin-sink-utils.dummy(7).

`utils.muxer` *filter*::
    Multiplexes the events received on its multiple input connections by
    time to its single output connection.
+
See man:babeltrace-plugin-filter-utils.muxer(7).

`utils.trimmer` *filter*::
    Discards all the received events with a timestamp less than a given
    beginning timestamp and greater than a given end timestamp,
    effectively ``cutting'' the traces.
+
See man:babeltrace-plugin-filter-utils.trimmer(7).
