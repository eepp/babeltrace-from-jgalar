NAME
----
babeltrace-plugin-filter-utils.mux - Babeltrace's multiplexer utility
filter component class


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The Babeltrace `utils.mux` filter component class, member of the
man:babeltrace-plugin-utils(7) plugin, once instantiated, multiplexes
the notifications received on multiple input ports into a linear
sequence of notifications ordered by time on its output connection.

----
        +-----------+
        | utils.mux |
... --->@   filter  |
        |           @---> ...
... --->@           |
        |           |
        +-----------+
----

The events and other notifications are untouched: the `utils.mux`
filter component only sorts them.

A `utils.mux` filter component's iterator signals the end of the
iteration when all its input iterators are also done.


INITIALIZATION PARAMETERS
-------------------------
The following parameters are optional unless indicated otherwise.

IMPORTANT: TODO.


PORTS
-----
A `utils.mux` filter component, immediately after its creation, has
a single input port named `in0`. When you connect an upstream port
to this port, a new port `in1` is created and free, and so on.


QUERY OBJECTS
-------------
This component class has no objects to query.
